# RiceSense-Nutrient-Defficiency-Classification-for-Rice
RiceSense is an AI-based rice leaf nutrient deficiency classification using image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). RiceSense can detect whether a rice plant is healthy or has any of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) or Potassium (K) deficiency. Various CNN models were trained and tested to come up the best model such as Xception, Inception V3, and customized model. It is found out that Xception model acheived the highest accuracy and effective in classifying nutrient deficiencies in rice. This project is part of the requirements for the DigiLabs Aritificial Intelligence Foundational Course organized by <a href='https://www.sif.org.sg/Our-Work/Volunteer-Cooperation/E-volunteering-Programmes/DigiLABS'> Singapore International Foundation (SIF) </a>
